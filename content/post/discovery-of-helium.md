Discovered in the spectral lines on the sun, during the 1868 solar ecplipse in the chromosphere of the sun.


College of Chemistry in London tried to reproduce the lines, but could not, suggesting that it was an element unknown [St Andrews](http://www-solar.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~clare/Lockyer/helium.html)

Discovered in natural gas in Kansas in 1905. The gas that wouldn't burn. [American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/heliumnaturalgas.html)
They had drilled a well that promised to be a "howling gasser".
Was releasing 9 million cubic feet per day (250,000 L per day) of gas.
Planned a huge celebration, with music, speeches, and games, with the climax being to light the escaping gas, which would burn day and night.

A burning bale of hay was pushed towards the gusher, but instead of ingiting, bale was put out. Repeated several times.
Crowd went away disappointed, saying that the well was a well of "hot air", not natural gas.

Scientists from the University of Kansas came and took a sample and analysed it. It was 15% methane (natural gas), but also 72% nitrogen, hence why it didn't burn, and also 12% of another inert residue.
Used coconut charcoal to purify the gas, and used spectroscopic analysis to find that it contained helium, in fact it contained 1.2% helium. Helium was no longer rare, but could be produced in large quantities, if anyone could think of a use for it.
