When you walk through the doors of the museum here in Melbourne, there is a gigantic entrance hall which contains the entire skeleton of a blue whale. Walking throughout the Museum, there are dinosaurs and insects, there are gemstones of translucent purple, milky blue, and a thousand other colours. There is the skeleton of a giant extinct wombat, ???, which was the size of a car and which I like to imagine grazing in gentle herds on the plains of Western Victoria. There is an entire native rainforest in a room, with actual plants and trees and a pond full of fish. There is an extraordinary kids play room, with rope ladders going up a series of tunnels, leading to a network of rooms over your head and then back down to the ground. It takes 20 minutes to crawl from one end to the other, so if you see your kids up there halfway through it, there is nothing to do but watch them and hope they don't get stuck.

_Back then, the Smithsonian was just one building. "Everything was crammed into this one wonderfully dark and musty old building. It was like the nation's attic and, like an attic, it was gloriously random. Over here was the shirt Lincoln was wearing when he was shot, with a dried brown bloodstain above the heart. Over there was a diorama of a Navajo family fixing dinner. Up above you, hanging from the gloomy rafters, were the_ Spririt of St Louis _and the Wright brothers' first plane. You didn't know where to look next or what you would find around each corner. Now, it is as if everything has been sorted out by a fussy spinster, folded neatly and put in its proper place. You go to the Air and Space Museum and you see the Spirit of St Louis and the Wright brother's place and lots of other famous planes and rocket ships and it's all highly impressive, but it is also clinical and uninspired. If your brother came running up to you and said, "Hey, you'll never guess what I found in this room over here!" you would in fact guess, more or less, because it would have to be either and airplane or a rocket ship. At the old Smithsonian it could have been absolutely anything--a petrified dog, Custer's scalp, human heads adrift in bottles_
