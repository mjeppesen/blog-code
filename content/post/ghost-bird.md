A few years ago, in the middle of winter, my wife Zoe and I moved from our house in inner Melbourne to Cairns in Far North Queensland. Tropical Queensland felt very different to southern Australia. The sun in Cairns was strong and bright, and the landscape seemed to be an intense green, instead of the blue-green, straw yellow and sandy brown colours we were used to. There was rainforest in the hills behind the town, and sugar cane growing along the highway.

We rented at house at Yorkey's Knob, which is one of the suburbs north of Cairns. (The annual town party is called Festival of the Knob). It has a lovely beach (which you can't swim in, both for crocodiles and stinging jellyfish). Across from the beach were a few holiday houses, and a melaleuca scrubland the size of a football field, which was surrounded by a tall plywood temporary fence which was beginning to fall down. Behind all this were the houses where people lived, a few shops, and the Knob itself, which is a rocky hill with great views out to the Coral Sea. It was a quiet and sleepy town (although I since learned that the fenced off melaleuca scrub may become a 4,000 bed hotel and resort, so possibly not for long).

Our house also backed onto the melaleuce and tea tree scrub, which was very pretty, with electric blue Ulyssues butterflies which would fly out into our back garden. However, after we lived there for a few weeks it occurred to me that during the wet season, the scrub might become a wetland or even a swamp, which in the land of crocodiles and dengue fever makes you thoughtful. Certainly, at night the scrub lively and noisy, with croaking frogs and toads and the occaisonal eerie shriek, "oooauaiiii", a wail into the darkness. At the back of the garden, bordering onto the scrub was the compost bin, and two mature paw paw trees laden with fruit. Every now and then an enormous amethyst python (Australia's largest snake) would be lying on top of and around the bin, in the sun. It was at least five metres long, with a body as thick as my arm. You could see it lying there from the back door, and since it didn't surprise me

We planted a veggie garden in our backgarden, with lots of new plants we couldn't grow easily down south: okra, snake beans, lemongrass, sweet potato, paw paw, as well as a new fruit which I only heard of for the first time at a local restaurant:

  "Would you like rosella jam on the cheesecake?"
  "Ah, is the jam made from ... rosellas?"
  "Oh, yes, certainly."
  "The ... bird?"
  "No, no! Oh no, the fruit."
The fruit? I had never heard of it, but after that I had to try and grow some. The plants never really grew, though, so I still don't know what the fruit look like uncooked.






A few years ago my uncle was working as a weather observer on Lord Howe Island, and my wife Zoe and I went to stay with him and his partner. And that was th
