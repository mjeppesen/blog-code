Today is an interesting anniversary in the history of solar power: the sixtieth anniversary of solar panels in space. On 17 March 1958, the American satellite [_Vanguard 1_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_1) entered orbit, becoming the fourth satellite ever to do so, and the first to use solar power. _Vanguard 1_ was small enough to be held by a person in one hand -- 1.5 kg (3 lbs) in mass and 16 cm (6") in diameter, or 76 cm (30") wide including the antenna aerials. Altogether, _Vanguard 1_ had 6 silicon solar panels which generated about [1 watt](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1958-002B). For comparison, the power produced by a typical rooftop solar PV system in 2018 is several thousand times greater.

How did the first satellites use electrical power? Mainly, to send radio signals back to earth. The first satellite ever to reach orbit, the Soviet satellite [_Sputnik_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1), broadcast radio signals at 20 MHz and 40 MHz which could be detected on earth, even by amateur radio users. The radio signals provided additional proof that the satellite was really in orbit around the earth (it could also be seen with large telescopes), and allowed observers to measure its position and trajectory. The power to provide this radio signal came from batteries, which allowed it to broadcast radio signals for 21 days before the batteries went flat.

This radio communication was one-way only. Early satellites could not receive communications from earth, and were essentially a battery, radio transmitter, and an antenna. The second and third satellites, the Soviet _Sputnik 2_ and US _Explorer 1_ also used batteries to power radio signals, which lasted somewhat longer (_Explorer 1_ had a lower power mode that lasted 105 days).

_Vanguard 1_ had [two radio transmitters](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1958-002B). One transmitter (at 108 MHz) had a battery system, which lasted for 20 days. The second transmitter (at a slightly higher radio frequency, 108.3 MHz) was powered by the (as yet unproven in space) solar panels, and that broadcast for over _six years_ or over 23,000 orbits, before going silent.

Satellites and spaceflight were one the first uses of solar power in which it was clearly the best choice for the job -- cheaper, more reliable, and more practical than any other source of electrical power.

This was one of the first times that solar power was the easiest and cheapest


Solar electric cells were invented over one hundred years ago. But for most of that time they were very expensive, and for almost every application there was an alternative that was more suitable.

One of the first practical applications of solar cells was for spacecraft. On Earth, oxygen is everywhere and fuel can usually be found (wood, coal, natural gas etc.), so combustion was an inexpensive and practical way to produce either heat, move things around, or make electricity. In space, combustion requires that both fuel and oxygen (or another oxidant) be brought along. For rockets, this how they work, most rockets carry tanks of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen or to burn as rocket fuel (for example, the Saturn V rockets that sent humans to the moon used
