Discovered in natural gas in Kansas in 1905. The gas that wouldn't burn. [American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/heliumnaturalgas.html)
They had drilled a well that promised to be a "howling gasser".
Was releasing 9 million cubic feet per day (250,000 L per day) of gas.
Planned a huge celebration, with music, speeches, and games, with the climax being to light the escaping gas, which would burn day and night.

A burning bale of hay was pushed towards the gusher, but instead of ingiting, bale was put out. Repeated several times.
Crowd went away disappointed, saying that the well was a well of "hot air", not natural gas.
