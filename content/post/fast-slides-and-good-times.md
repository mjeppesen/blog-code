Not far from where I live is a fantastic playground. There are swings, cubby houses, roundabouts, and in the center is an enormous tower with two slides down to the ground.

The slides are made from metal, not plastic, so there are no static electic shocks and they are _fast_. The lower slide is ok for young children who can walk and climb, but it has a slight corner and they can come out sideways if they're not careful. The upper slide has a steep section, with a lot of acceleration, and for older kids it's a lot of fun.

There are a few extraordinary parks near my home town. There is a [children's playground](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/-37.83041/144.97594) in the Melbourne Botanic Gardens with a small stream of water running through it, and kids will splash and stomp through the water and have a lovely time. Bacchus Marsh is a small country town, but across from the train station is a park with a [huge wooden castle](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/-37.68542/144.43682), with four towers connected by bridges with slides to the ground.

These parks make me happy, they are a tremendous public good [for everyone to share](http://jpp.sn/post/what-a-country). They make life a little bit better for everyone, and I'm grateful to all the people who helped to help make them.
