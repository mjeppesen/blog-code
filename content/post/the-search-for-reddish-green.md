This is a story about the search for Reddish Green --- the possibly real but hard to find place, with the wonderful name of an impossible colour.

First, the colour, and why it is interesting. "Reddish green" is sometimes used to describe objects that are partly red and partly green, which is fair enough, but there is no single colour "reddish green".


"Greenish blue" and "Reddish blue" do exist.
Here is a bluish green eucalypt tree in Bacchus Marsh, Australia.

The Charlotte Hornets [@hornets](https://twitter.com/hornets) is a bluish green.

As is the Port Adelaide Football [@PAFC](https://twitter.com/PAFC).

The [Harvard](https://twitter.com/Harvard) crest is a bluish red.

When red light and green light are combined, the resulting light looks yellow, as in this video from the Royal Institution [@Ri_Science](https://twitter.com/Ri_Science) with Steve Mould [@MouldS](https://twitter.com/MouldS) https://youtu.be/iPPYGJjKVco.

But yellow is yellow, it is a colour (and a wavelength of light) all its own.
(A range of wavelengths, in fact, 570--590 nm).
The way our eyes work, we cannot tell the difference between yellow light and red + green light.

Green + blue light looks cyan or teal, which looks greenish blue. Red + blue light looks purple, which looks reddish blue. Red + green light together looks yellow, which (to me) does not look “reddish green”. (Image [@laserclassroom](https://twitter.com/laserclassroom)) http://laserclassroom.com/what-colors-make-yellow/

If our eyes had specialised yellow light detectors, as they do for red, green, and blue light, then perhaps red + green light would look different to yellow light. There may not be no answer, but I wonder... in that case, what might red + green light look like?

There may even be a very, very, small number of people whose eyes have these yellow detectors. (if they exist, such people would be called tetrachromats). [Jad Abumrad](https://twitter.com/JadAbumrad) and [Robert Krulwich](https://twitter.com/rkrulwich) investigate this possibility in an episode of [Radiolab](https://twitter.com/Radiolab) :

Here is another way to potentially see "reddish-green", or at least a strange effect that could be called so. If you send two different images to each eye, one green and one red -- e.g., a picture of a green car to your left eye and picture of the same car but red instead of green to your right eye -- then the brain will try to see a single colour, and it creates an effect that is arguably "reddish green". This could be done with a 3D glasses and a 3D projector, for example. I have not done the experiment myself, and I am keen to do one day.

Something similar may happen if you look at the picture below and cross your eyes, so that you see three boxes -- the middle one may appear "reddish green". (To me ... it sort of works).

So reddish green the colour is an impossible colour. Now, on the [Wikipedia page for impossible colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color) there is a note:

> _'"Reddish green" redirects here. Reddish Green is also a place in Reddish, Stockport, in Greater Manchester in England.'_

Reddish Green. What a great name. And it makes sense: if Reddish is a town in England, well ... what else would you call the village green?

Well I would like to find Reddish Green place on the map but ...  where is it? The Wikipedia page for Reddish does not mention it. “Reddish Green” doesn't appear in Google maps, Apple Maps, Open Street Map, Bing Maps.
