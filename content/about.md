My name is Matthew Jeppesen. I live in Melbourne, Australia. I am a co-founder of [Proa Analytics](http://proaanalytics.com) and an honorary research fellow at [Melbourne University](http://www.unimelb.edu.au). On twitter I am [@matthewjeppesen](https://twitter.com/matthewjeppesen).

This website is a personal blog, however, where I write about ideas and stories that interest me. The opinions and so on here are mine alone.
